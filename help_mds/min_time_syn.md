### Minimum Time for Synergy Calculation

This parameter establishes which is the first time point from which to start calculating the drug combination effect.

For highly complex models — such as those incorporating within-group unequal variances — SynergyLMM may encounter convergence issues when analyzing early time points with limited tumor measurements. One way to solve this is increasing the minimum time for synergy calculation, ensuring that there is enough data to fit the model and calculate the drug combination effect.
