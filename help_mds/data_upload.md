## Data Uploading

The input data should be a data table in **long format**; that means that each row should correspond to a tumor measurement.

The table should have at least four columns: one for **sample IDs**, one for the **time points**, one to indicate the **treatment group**, and one for the **tumor volume measurements** (additional columns can be present but they will be ignored).

You can download the example dataset as a reference.
