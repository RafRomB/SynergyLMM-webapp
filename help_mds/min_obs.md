### Minimum Observations per Subject

This parameter defines the minimum number of measurements required for each subject to be included in the analysis. For example, if you set this value to `3`, any subjects with fewer than 3 measurements will be excluded from the analysis. 

This may be useful if you want to ensure  that only subjects with sufficient data contribute to the results, improving the reliability of the analysis.
