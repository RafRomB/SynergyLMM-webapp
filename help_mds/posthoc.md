### Post Hoc Power Analysis

The _post hoc_ (retrospective) power analysis allows to evaluate the statistical power for the provided dataset and fitted model. Traditionally, a threshold of 0.8 (80%) is used as an acceptable level of power ([Serdar CC et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.11613/BM.2021.010502)).

Since the drug combination effect is time-dependent, the statistical power vary depending on the time point being analyzed. You can choose which time point to analyse using the slider.

The _post hoc_ power analysis is based on simulations. You can specify the number of simulations to run, as well as the significance (p-value) threshold.
