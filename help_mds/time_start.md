## Time Start

_Time Start_ refers to the starting time point of the experiment (i.e. the time point when the treatment administration is started). Usually, this will be referred as _0_, but different users may use different notations.

By default, the value is set to the minimum value of the _Time_ column, but it can be changed to select which time point should be used as the initial time point.
